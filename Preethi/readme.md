## Challenges Faced

During the development of this website, I encountered several challenges. Here are some of the difficulties I faced and how I overcame them:

1. **Limited Interactivity:**
 HTML and CSS are primarily used for structuring and styling content, respectively. They lack the ability to provide advanced interactivity and dynamic behavior. If your website requires complex user interactions, you might need to incorporate JavaScript or other technologies and we have also used some Javascript.

2. **Maintenance Issues:**
 As the complexity of your website grows, maintaining consistency in design and layout can become challenging. Small changes might require updates across multiple HTML files, leading to potential errors.

3. **Responsiveness:**
This was also a major challenge, as this is the first time doing a whole website as a team and we have to make sure the page is responsive for different media screens. Ensuring consistent display across various web browsers can be challenging. Different browsers may interpret CSS rules or HTML elements differently, leading to inconsistencies in the user experience.

4. **Limited Animation and Transition Effects:** While CSS does offer some animation and transition capabilities, creating complex animations may require JavaScript or other technologies. This limitation can affect the overall user experience on more dynamic websites.

5. **Longer Page Load Times:**
 For larger websites or those with a significant amount of content, relying solely on static HTML files might result in longer page load times, especially if content is not optimized or cached effectively.

By documenting these challenges and solutions, I hope to provide insights for others who may be embarking on a similar learning journey. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the extension.
